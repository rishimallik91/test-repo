Launch an Amazon Linux Machine
yum install python
yum install pip -y
pip install ansible
ansible --version ( You will be seeing config file as none )
cd /etc/
mkdir ansible
cd ansible
mkdir roles and touch ansible.cfg and touch roles
Check ansible --version ( Now you will get the default directory structure )
Create user ansadmin and give password
GIve root priveleges to ansadmin by going to visudo
Need to change password authentication as YES by going into vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Switch to the user ansadmin by sudo su ansadmin
Generate key by using ssh-keygen
Go to .ssh/ and you will find private key and public key 
Create same username in the other nodes as well and switch to that user 
Now we need to connect to other node by using this key by using command ssh-copy-id 
To check whether it is connected or not use command ssh<ip address>
Go vi hosts and add the node ip address over there,save it 
Hit ansible all -m ping -i hosts
